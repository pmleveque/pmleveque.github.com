The last four years of my life were dedicated to philosophy—that is love of wisdom; and theology—the logos of God, that is a rational discourse about the Absolute.
Innovation means looking towards the future, and those sciences seem to be about the past. Is that true?
It is. However it is not about a revoked past. It is about the foundations of our present and future. Innovation is not about ex nihilo[^1] creation, it is about evolving some existing reality[^2].

When I start speaking about my coursework in philosophy and theology, I cannot help adding anthropology. Literally: a rational discourse about Man. The Absolute is known only through Man, it reveals Itself through Man, and then, there is no way one can try to understand the Principle of all things without looking for some kind of knowledge about the human reality.

This is the place where technological innovation and ancient wisdom meet. The human reality. Phenomenology is the name given by the twentieth-century philosophers to their studies on this matter. Twenty-first century engineers sum it up with two letters—UX. That became the core of new developing methodologies like agile programming, and now the doctrine of the lean startup.

Forgot the human? Forget success. This is the good news of this beginning third millennium. Success is not programmatic; there’s no algorithm, no formal method to ensure success, unless the human reality be taken into account. Not a theoretical human reality, but a living one. Products have to be experienced by real people to be relevant.

Still, the vast majority of business strategies ignore this essential character of innovation. Those having built their fortune by making the human fit into their creations will encounter progressive failure, whereas those relying on a deep human empathy—not just intuition, or a generous feeling, but a living and practical empathy—will flourish.

Back to our initial question: what has theology to do with innovation? It is about a good or a bad theologian and about a good or a bad entrepreneur. The bad one will create theories (or products) out of the box. Then he will force people to submit (or buy). He may be successful: mass manipulation has proven efficiency in history (and in marketing).
The good one takes the human being as it is, in its environment. He establishes a relationship with singular persons. That does not mean submitting to each one, but giving the right answer to the right person.
